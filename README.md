# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data
Created for the Getting and Cleaning Data final project

The run_analysis.R script will excute the following actions

1. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Create descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Label the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. Create from the data created in step 4 an independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The Code Book describes the modifications performed by the script

And finaldata cotains the output of the script when you use the data provided by the instructors
