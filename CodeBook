The run_analysis.R script will perform the data preparation and the
5 steps required in the course project description.

Download the dataset from the address provided in the project description


Assign each data to variables
features <- features.txt : 561 rows, 2 columns
activities <- activity_labels.txt : 6 rows, 2 columns
subject_test <- test/subject_test.txt : 2947 rows, 1 column
x_test <- test/X_test.txt : 2947 rows, 561 columns
y_test <- test/y_test.txt : 2947 rows, 1 columns
subject_train <- test/subject_train.txt : 7352 rows, 1 column
x_train <- test/X_train.txt : 7352 rows, 561 columns
y_train <- test/y_train.txt : 7352 rows, 1 columns

Merge the training and test sets to create one dataset
X (10299 rows, 561 columns) is created by merging x_train and x_test
Y (10299 rows, 1 column) is created by merging y_train and y_test
Subject (10299 rows, 1 column) is created by merging subject_train and subject_test
Merged_Data (10299 rows, 563 column) is created by merging Subject, Y and X

Extract only the measurements on mean and standard deviation for each measurement
TidyData (10299 rows, 88 columns) is created by subsetting Merged_Data

Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Numbers in code column replaced with corresponding activity

Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
code column in TidyData renamed into activities
Acc replaced by accelerometer
Gyro replaced by gyroscope
BodyBody replaced by body
Mag by magnitude
f replaced by frequency
t replaced by time

Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
FinalData (180 rows, 88 columns) is created by sumarizing the data from the last step and taking the means of each variable
for each activity and each subject, after grouping them by subject and activity.

Export finaldata into finaldata.txt file.
